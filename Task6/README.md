## 1. **Theme**:
        The Theme of the landing page created by me is a gaming website which allos user to sign in and download the game.
## 2. **Motivation**:
        The motivation behind the theme is I love to play videogames. So, i did a landing page that I would create when I build a game.
## 3. **Future improvements**:
        I would like to make some chamges in the future to my landing page like keeping it clean and spaceous. Use more pleasing colours and put some creativity into it.
