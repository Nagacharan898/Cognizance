# *Landing Page*
*Hello! My name is Nagacharan.*

*I am going to describe my Landing page on the game called* ***THE ORDER***
___
## **1. Theme**:
       The Theme of the landing page created by me is a gaming website. It allows user to sign in and download the game which is available for both Windows and MacOS. The background of the page is a wallpaper with an in-game character on it. The logo of the game is very neat and simple. It is in bold black letters which attracts people when they see it.

## **3. Motivation**:

        The motivation behind the theme is I love to play videogames. I used to play games whenever i get free time. I used to play FPS(first person shooter) games more and it is my favorite genre. I am so into games that i wanted to design a game in future. So, i did a landing page that I would make when I build a game.
___
## **4. Future improvements**:
        This design is still in the early stages so we might change some notable points in the landing page like cleaning the page and make it more spaceous, picking right colours and making your eyes pleasing and make the website more interative to the user. The landing page changes are seen whenever there's an update in the game. The main aim is to make the website feel attractive to the users and I am ready to make worthy changes accordingly.
